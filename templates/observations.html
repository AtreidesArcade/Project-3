            The original data was downloaded as csv files from Kaggle and the World Bank, before being cleaned using 
            Python, Pandas, NumPy and pushed to a Postgres database using SQLAlchemy.<br>
            <br>
            The new csv files were then taken and converted into a SQLite database for this project. SQLite was used 
            for a more efficient connection, rather than connecting directly to the Postgres database and remapping the tables. 
            After connecting to the database with SQLAlchemy, further cleaning was done using Python inside Jupyter Notebook to 
            format the data to the structure necessary for this analysis before returning the data as a JSON.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px">
                    We first wanted to create a summarized view performance by countires. To visualize this, we decided on a choropleth map using <code>Leaflet.js</code> and 
                    <code>geoJSON</code> to represent the percentage of gold medals won by each country out of all available gold 
                    medals each year. Athletes from countries with colder climates tend to be more successful, suggesting that monetary wealth is not the only indicator of success. 
                    Future analysis would look into climate as well as elevation and compare performance each year of the games to the location of the games.

                <p style="font-size: 16px">
                As a way to showcase the relationship between GDP Per Capita and Medals won, we created bubble plot using <code>chart.js</code>, markers were grouped by medal type, and the radius set to represent GDP. The expectation was to see larger circles higher up 
                the y-axis, which represented the total count of medals. However, the markers highest up the y-axis, were not the same 
                markers with greater radii. This signaled that GDP may not be as influential as initially assumed. Future 
                analyses would look for any shared attributes between highest performing countries and compare that to any shared 
                attributes between countries with higher GDP.</p>

                Using <code>plotly.js</code> , a line graph was made that compares individual country 
                performances, analyzing the relationship between population size and percentage of medals won. A 
                country’s relative population size was calculated by dividing said country’s population over the sum population 
                of all countries that medaled in a given year. This means that only countries that won medals were taken into 
                consideration. If a country did not win any medals in a specified year, their population data was not used. The 
                assumption was that a country with more competing athletes would then also win more medals. Total world population 
                was not used as it was not the best representation of who competes in the Winter Olympics.<br>
                <br>
                We did not find a strong correlation between population and medals. China 
                had a consistently high relative population (53-56%) and yet only won 1-3% of available medals. Norway on the other 
                hand, had a consistently low relative population (less than 1%) and yet performed at a consistently high level. Again, 
                pointing to the idea that perhaps climate is a stronger indicator of performance.</p>
